In baseball, player profiles can vary widely depending on the context in which they're used. Generally, they can be categorized based on the player's role within a team, their statistical performance, and their physical attributes. Here are some common types of player profiles:

1. *Roster Player*: Part of a baseball team roster, such as high school, NCAA, or professional teams. Their profiles are usually managed by the organization and are read-onlyÂ¹.

2. *Official Player*: Players from an official database maintained by organizations like TrackMan, which includes players from professional teams, colleges, and scouting events. Their profiles are also read-onlyÂ¹.

3. *Private Player*: Created by system users, such as coaches or scouts, and can be edited freely. These profiles are used to track performance during practice sessions or gamesÂ¹.

4. *Contact Hitter*: A player known for their ability to hit the ball consistently and get on base.

5. *Power Hitter*: A player who hits for a high slugging percentage, often associated with home runs and extra-base hits.

6. *Speedster*: A player known for their speed on the bases, often leading to stolen bases and scoring from positions where others could not.

7. *Defensive Specialist*: A player whose defensive skills are a significant part of their value to the team.

8. *Utility Player*: A versatile player who can play multiple positions competently.

9. *Starting Pitcher*: A pitcher who starts the game and is expected to pitch for several innings.

10. *Relief Pitcher*: A pitcher who comes into the game after the starting pitcher, often in specific situations.

11. *Closer*: A type of relief pitcher used at the end of the game to secure the final outs when the team is leading.

These profiles help teams and analysts categorize players for various purposes, such as scouting, performance evaluation, and strategic decision-making. Each profile highlights different aspects of a player's skills and contributions to the team. ðŸ“Šâš¾

I suppose from the hitting data correlation chart, one will be able to tell what sort of player profiles the baseball players have?
